step1
create useradd -m ansible
passwd ansible
echo "ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/ansible

step2
switch to ansible user
generate key pair using below command. This would generate a private and a public key inside .ssh directory:
ssh-keygen -t rsa

STEP3-
On hosts:
cd .ssh
vi authorized_keys
copy the public key id_rsa.pub content from the controller and copy it inside authorized_keys

STEP4- Form controller server verify that ssh connection between controller and host is getting established:
ssh <private IP of host>

STEP5- update inventory file , create a host group and add host IPs to the group
cd /etc/ansible/hosts
sudo vi hosts
[myhosts]
172.31.38.127
172.31.45.115


Ansible Adhoc commands:
ubuntu user:
ansible --inventory /etc/ansible/hosts myhosts -m ping
ansible all -m ping
ansible all --list-hosts
ansible all -m shell -a "ls -altr" //list all files on hosts
ansible myhosts[1] -m shell -a "touch newfile" // create file in server at 1st index
ansible all -m shell -a "apt install git" //permission denied since no sudo used
ansible all -m shell -a "sudo apt install git" //will work since we have used sudo
ansible all -m shell -a "apt install git" -b //will work since we have used -b ie become sudo
ansible all -m copy -a "src=hellofile dest=/home/sysops"
ansible all -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=present" -b
ansible all -m service -a "name=apache2 state=stopped" -b
ansible all -m shell -a "free -m"

ec2 user: 
ansible all -m shell -a "sudo yum install git -y" //to install git
